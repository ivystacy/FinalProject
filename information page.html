  <h1><center><class="double">Endangered Animals</center></h1>
  <h2>Sea Turtles</h2>
    <p>There are seven species of sea turtles in the world, and they're all endangered. Most times they are killed for their shells, meat, and eggs. Sea turtles are very vunerable to ocean pollution. The toxins in waste is harmful to these creatures. The chemicals can cause harm a quicky through direct contact or it can biuld up in tissues over a course of time. Most turtles end up dying.</p>
  <h4>What we can do to help.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Do not buy souvenirs or other items made from critically endangered hawksbill shell.</li>
    <li>Choose responsibly caught seafood.</li>
    <li> Just say NO to plastics! </li>
    <li>Join a volunteer expedition and contribute to conservation efforts.</li>
    <li>Donate to a worthy cause.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Bees</h2>
    <p>Honey bees are going extinct at an alarming rate! We're sure you have heard this before. Honey bees are a very important part of our lives surprisingly. They pollinate food crops, and help nature around us grow, and so much more! Without them there wouldn't be the yummy fruits you like to eat. When pesticides are sprayed on crops, it prevents bees from being able to do their job. Also blood-sucking parasites reduce bee colonies. They're big trouble.  </p>
    <h4>What we can do to help.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Plant bee-friendly flowers and flowering herbs in your garden and yard.</li>
      <li>Don't use chemicals and pesticides to treat your lawn or garden.</li>
      <li>Buy local, raw honey.</li>
      <li>Understand that bees are not trying to harm you.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Rhinos</h2>
    <p>Rhinos contribute to economic growth and development through tourism, that creates job opportunities and provides benefits to local communities living near rhinos. They are going extinct because poachers hunt them for their horns, and loss of habitat. </p>
    <h4>What we can do to help.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Donate to protect rhinos.</li>
      <li>Educate people</li>
      <li>Ban rhino horn sale</li>
      <li>Rhino horn poisoning</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Elephants</h2>
  <p>Because ivory is so valuable to some humans, many elephants have been killed for their tusks. An elephants' role is to pull down trees and break up thorny bushes. As a result, they create grasslands and salt licks in order to make other animals' lives easier to survive in their environment. They also create water holes by digging in dry river beds.</p>
  <h4>What we can do to help.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Don't buy ivory. Or sell it, or wear it.</li>
  <li>Buy elephant-friendly coffee and wood.</li>
  <li>Support conservation efforts.</li>
  <li>Adopt an elephant.</li>
  <li>Be aware.</li>
</ul>
